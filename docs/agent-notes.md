# Agent notes

This directory is reserved for lightweight documentation generated while working on this repo. It can be expanded with additional runbooks, troubleshooting notes, and release checklists as the tools evolve.

## Repo orientation

- The repo root is a toolbox of Linux streaming utilities.
- Each top-level folder is a standalone tool with its own docs, config expectations, and attribution.

## Working checklist

- Update tool-specific docs alongside any script changes.
- Keep README files concise and focused on usage and setup.
- Prefer shell snippets that match how the scripts are meant to be invoked.
