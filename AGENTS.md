## Repo scope guidance

- This repository is a collection of Linux streaming tools. Each top-level folder is a different tool with its own documentation and supporting files.
- Keep README updates aligned with the tool they describe.
- Prefer Debian/Devuan-friendly install instructions when documenting prerequisites.

## Workflow notes

- Document changes in `docs/` when helpful for future maintenance.
- Avoid adding binary files to the repository.
