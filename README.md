# linuxstreamtools

A grab bag of Linux streaming-related tools and experiments. The repo root is a general landing zone for stream utilities I make or have made; each folder contains a different tool plus any supporting files or documentation. The first piece being released is `streamlinkbgm/streamlink_3.sh`.

## Contents

- `streamlinkbgm/`: Background music automation tooling for Streamlink + MPV, with docs and attribution.
- `obs_stuff/`: OBS websocket helpers for meme triggers and cutaway gags, including `memen_demon` and "take my cut, please!".

## Repository structure

- Each tool lives in its own directory.
- Supporting files (configs, docs, attribution, etc.) are stored alongside the tool that uses them.
